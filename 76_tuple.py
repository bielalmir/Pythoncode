#A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable, and iterable collection of elements enclosed in parentheses ( ).

#while making a tuple it's like list but we don't use square bracrs we use normal paranthesis


tup = (44, 33, 22, 11, 88)
print(type(tup))        #this is how we check the type


tup = (33, 44, 66, 77)
print(tup [0 : 4])    #this is how we excess the element of a tuple
